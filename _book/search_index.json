to directly build margin positions using established DEXs and lending protocols. Our objective is to bring a universal aggregator service (comparable to Interactive Brokers in CeFi) to EVMs. Unbound by our own liquidity, we do not have the same limitations that comparable decentralized aggregators experience. Our goal is to partner with and aggregate established protocols in the space and not to directly compete against them.\nAt the moment, crypto traders are limited in the options they have for building leverage while trading. If they choose to use money market protocols for building margin positions they will face a multi-step process that spans multiple dApps, is error-prone, and has low visibility.\nExisting aggregator/derivatives platforms have been the go-to solution for leveraged trading, however, they come with a steep tradeoff.  While centralized players like FTX have failed users by misusing their funds, decentralized platforms like dYdX or GMX are required to provide both lending and trading liquidity often resulting in poor trading performance.\nOur vision is to bring fully-featured, decentralized aggregator services to EVMs. This includes\n\nSingle-click margin trading (opening, closing positions, debt- and collateral swaps)\nConnecting established DEXs with established lending protocols to allow our users to access top-notch trading performance and highly competitive deposit and borrow rates\nSeamless UX and visibility - easy risk management through risk parameter displays and single-click self-liquidations\nFull transparency - Users hold the lending protocol balances themselves and can always see and access their raw balances with the lender\nLending protocols have been less accessible to traders who are looking for a fully-featured aggregator. With 1Delta, we hope to open the door for these traders to take advantage of the strong liquidity and attractive rates on large lending protocols without sacrificing the tools they have come to expect while trading.\n\nThe project’s mid-term roadmap is given by its milestones over the next 6 to 12 months. However, 1Delta’s vision goes far beyond the milestones mentioned below.\nAfter jump-starting our initial traction, 1Delta will maintain itself through the collection of small fees on top of DEX trading fees and interest income. We are also exploring the potential of payment for TVL / order flow models.\n"},"margin-aggregation.html":{"url":"margin-aggregation.html","title":"Margin Aggregation","keywords":"","body":"Margin Trade Aggregation\nUnder \"margin trade aggregation\" we understand the process of \nMargin Trading In DeFi\n\nHow 1delta automates the flow\n\n"},"doc/doc-overview.html":{"url":"doc/doc-overview.html","title":"Architecture","keywords":"","body":"Architecture\nDependent on the architecture of the DEX or lending protocol, 1delta implented a different\n\nBroker Architecture\nAbstract Account Architecture\n\n"},"doc/doc-intro.html":{"url":"doc/doc-intro.html","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"What Does 1delta Do?\ntest\n"},"doc/doc-broker.html":{"url":"doc/doc-broker.html","title":"Broker architecture","keywords":"","body":"General interface for aggregatoion of trading on AAVE\ntest\n"},"doc/doc-abstract-account.html":{"url":"doc/doc-abstract-account.html","title":"Abstract accounts","keywords":"","body":"1delta Abstract Accounts\n1delta Accounts are user-controlled smart contracts that allow the automation of lending pool interactions and their connecting swaps. \nFlash loans / swaps are used to execute the interactions in a single transaction — this would mostly be impossible without abstract accounts on lending protocols similar to Compound.\n"},"how-to/how-to.html":{"url":"how-to/how-to.html","title":"How Tos","keywords":"","body":"How To Use 1delta\n1delta has a unique approach to margin trading.\n\nBrokering\nAbstract accounts\n\n"},"how-to/how-to-broker.html":{"url":"how-to/how-to-broker.html","title":"Brokering","keywords":"","body":"How to use 1delta\ntest\n"},"how-to/how-to-abstract-account.html":{"url":"how-to/how-to-abstract-account.html","title":"Abstract accounts","keywords":"","body":"How to use 1delta\ntest\n"},"api/api-summary.html":{"url":"api/api-summary.html","title":"Contract API","keywords":"","body":"Contract Interfaces\nThe following subsections describe the smart contract api for both the brokerage/aggreagation contract as well as for abstract account contracts. \n\nMoney Market\nBorrow Swap\nCollateral Swap\nOpen Margin Position\nClose Margin Position\n\n"},"api/api-money-market.html":{"url":"api/api-money-market.html","title":"Money Market","keywords":"","body":"Money Market Functions\n"},"api/api-borrow-swap.html":{"url":"api/api-borrow-swap.html","title":"Borrow Swap","keywords":"","body":"Borrow Swap Functions\nFunction: swapBorrowExactIn\nThis function allows a user to execute a swap on Uniswap V3 to borrow an exact amount of tokens in a single-pool trade, adjusting for the interest rate mode.\nParameters:\nparams (ExactInputSingleParamsBase memory): A struct containing parameters for the single-pool trade.\n\ntokenIn (address): The address of the input token.\n\nfee (uint24): The fee tier of the pool to be used for the swap.\n\ntokenOut (address): The address of the output token.\n\ninterestRateMode (uint256): The encoded interest rate mode, where the first digit represents the \"from\" interest rate and the second digit represents the \"to\" interest rate.\n\namountIn (uint256): The exact amount of input tokens to be swapped.\n\n\nReturns: uint256: The amount of output tokens received from the swap.\n\nFunction: swapBorrowExactInMulti\nThis function allows a user to execute a swap on Uniswap V3 to borrow an exact amount of tokens in a multi-pool trade, adjusting for the interest rate mode.\nParameters:\nparams (ExactInputMultiParams memory): A struct containing parameters for the multi-pool trade.\n\npath (bytes): A byte-encoded representation of the tokenIn, tokenOut, and fee of each pool to be used in the trade.\n\ninterestRateMode (uint256): The encoded interest rate mode, where the first digit represents the \"from\" interest rate and the second digit represents the \"to\" interest rate.\n\namountIn (uint256): The exact amount of input tokens to be swapped.\n\namountOutMinimum (uint256): The minimum amount of output tokens expected to be received from the swap.
