[{"url":"./","title":"Introduction","level":"1.1","keywords":[],"body":"Welcome to the 1delta Docs! 1delta is a decentralized margin aggregator service that allows users to directly build margin positions using established DEXs and lending protocols. Our objective is to bring a universal aggregator service (comparable to Interactive Brokers in CeFi) to EVMs. Unbound by our own liquidity, we do not have the same limitations that comparable decentralized aggregators experience. Our goal is to partner with and aggregate established protocols in the space and not to directly compete against them. At the moment, crypto traders are limited in the options they have for building leverage while trading. If they choose to use money market protocols for building margin positions they will face a multi-step process that spans multiple dApps, is error-prone, and has low visibility. Existing aggregator/derivatives platforms have been the go-to solution for leveraged trading, however, they come with a steep tradeoff. While centralized players like FTX have failed users by misusing their funds, decentralized platforms like dYdX or GMX are required to provide both lending and trading liquidity often resulting in poor trading performance. Our vision is to bring fully-featured, decentralized aggregator services to EVMs. This includes Single-click margin trading (opening, closing positions, debt- and collateral swaps) Connecting established DEXs with established lending protocols to allow our users to access top-notch trading performance and highly competitive deposit and borrow rates Seamless UX and visibility - easy risk management through risk parameter displays and single-click self-liquidations Full transparency - Users hold the lending protocol balances themselves and can always see and access their raw balances with the lender Lending protocols have been less accessible to traders who are looking for a fully-featured aggregator. With 1Delta, we hope to open the door for these traders to take advantage of the strong liquidity and attractive rates on large lending protocols without sacrificing the tools they have come to expect while trading.© 1delta https://1delta.io/Found an error in the docs?

This approach allows traders to increase their purchasing power and enhance their profit potential by leveraging their existing capital. However, it's essential to remember that margin trading also entails higher risks and can lead to significant losses if the market moves against the trader's position. In cryptocurrency margin trading, investors can access leverage, which is essentially a multiplier that amplifies the trader's capital. For example, if a trader uses 5x leverage, a $1,000 investment would provide them with $5,000 worth of purchasing power in the market. This increased exposure can lead to substantial gains if the market moves in their favor, but it can also magnify losses if the market goes against them. To engage in margin trading, traders are required to deposit an initial margin (or collateral) into a lending protocol. This collateral serves as a guarantee for the borrowed funds and is calculated as a percentage of the total position value. Different lenders may have different margin requirements, and traders should be aware of the specific policies of their chosen platform. When margin trading cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to understand the concept of liquidation. Liquidation occurs when the market moves against a trader's position to the point where their collateral is no longer sufficient to cover their losses. Lenders usually measure this using the health factor. In such a case, the health factor drops below 1 and the wallet will be flagged for liquidation, allowing another actor to close part of the position to recover the borrowed funds. In summary, margin trading for cryptocurrencies is a high-risk, high-reward trading strategy that can lead to significant profits or losses, depending on market movements. It's best suited for experienced traders who have a solid understanding of market dynamics and can effectively manage risk. Margin Trading In DeFi To open margin positions, users can manually loop through the following steps if they want to open an ETH-long position with 4x leverage. Supply initial collateral in ETH worth $1,000 Borrow $800 worth of USDC (80% of %1,000) Swap to ETH and supply again - This will give us another $640 (80% of $800) in borrowing capacity. We will now repeat this cycle until we obtained our target leverage. Borrow $640 (80% of $800), swap an supply Borrow $512 (80% of $640), swap an supply Borrow $409.6 (80% of $512), swap an supply Borrow $327.68 (80% of$409.6), swap an supply Borrow $262.144 (80% of$327.68), swap an supply Borrow $48.576 (the remaining amount to bring the total borrowed funds to $3,000) We see that building this leverage takes 22 transactions to complete as each sub-step in step 3. consists of 3 separate transactions. The following chart summarizes the general procedure. 1) A first USDT deposit is required for taking out a loan; 2) we can borrow WBTC to our wallet; 3) we swap WBTC to USDT on a DEX; 4) we deposit USDT to the lender; we repeat from step 2) until we reach the desired position size. Certainly, this cannot be the long-term solution to DeFi margin trading. 1delta uses unique methods and implementations that allow opening such positions in a maximum of 2 transactions, where the first one is just the initial supply of the collateral. How 1delta Automates The Flow We illustrate the example above using the 1delta protocol. Supply initial collateral in ETH worth $1,000 We use a flash swap and receive $3,000 of ETH and supply We supply the obtained ETH We can now borrow 80% of the $4,000 ($3,2000) in USDC the we supplied, we borrow $3,000 We repay the swap pool with the obtained $3,000 in USDC All sub-steps in step 2. happen within the same transaction. As such, there is no more manual looping when trying to build a leveraged position when using lending protocols. The following chart summarizes the interactions with the lender. Illustration of an abstract account that can open positions (borrow and supply) with flash swaps or flash loans in only two steps. As the 1Delta account is a smart contract, these steps can also be batch-executed in a single transaction.© 1delta https://1delta.io/Found an error in the docs? The source code can be found here.

Our initial version combines the simplicity of a lending protocol interface with well versed swap interfaces that will help you with building any position with the lender. Selecting a Trade To be able to pick positions, you only have to click the \"Start Trading\" button. Trades are then selected by clicking on the checkmarks next to the token icons. Dependent on your selection, the confirmation button will briefly summarize which type of trade can now be executed. The selections map to the trade types as follows. Single Collateral Position: Swap and deposit or withdraw and swap. Single Debt Position: Borrow and swap or swap and repay. Two Collateral Positions: Swap collateral positions. Two Debt Positions: Swap debt positions. One Collateral and one Debt Positions: Open a margin position (Borrow, swap and supply) or close one (withdraw collateral, swap and repay debt) The following chart shows hot the selections compose trade types.

Supply / Withdraw / Borrow / Repay To begin, we first select a trade type by clicking the \"Start Trading\" button, followed by choosing the specific position we wish to engage with. The screenshot below illustrates a selection of WETH as collateral, indicating that we intend to interact with a WETH collateral position. Selecting a single asset on the collateral side allows us to either withdraw or deposit to the lender. By clicking on the prominent blue button, we can now link a swap trade to either a deposit or withdrawal transaction. However, it's essential to deposit collateral first before proceeding with any other transaction types that include borrowing. On the left hand side, a direct supply is initiated, on the right hand side, a swap from USDC to WETH is done before supplying the obtained WETH. To initiate a withdrawal, click on \"Withdraw instead\" or the arrow situated between the input panels. In order to borrow or repay funds, select a single currency on the debt side. The default mode is set to borrowing; however, by clicking on \"Repay instead,\" we can opt to repay debt using our wallet balance. Open a margin position With collateral in place, we can now proceed to open a margin position by selecting one currency for collateral and another for debt. The example below demonstrates our selection for building a long WETH position funded by borrowing USDC. To execute the trade, we click the trade button once more. Choose a single currency for both collateral and debt sides, then click the trade button to configure the margin trade. The swap modal presents an overview of the trade details. We can either specify the amount of WETH we wish to deposit or the amount of USDC we want to borrow. First, we must approve the borrow delegation, which grants permission for the 1delta router to borrow funds on our behalf. Additionally, we can choose between different borrowing modes when trading on top of AAVE. The swap modal displays the trade's impact on our health factor and LTV. Upon successful execution of the trade, our positions will be displayed: After execution, our debt position in the selected interest rate mode and an increased WETH position will be visible. Swap debt With 1delta, we can effortlessly exchange our debt positions in just a single click. To swap our USDC debt for another currency, we simply select USDC and the target currency (in this case, WBTC) to access the debt swap trade configuration. We initiate the debt swap configuration by choosing two debt currencies. Within the trade configuration, we approve the borrow delegation (if not already done) to enable borrowing of WBTC. When selecting the maximum amount, 1delta's smart contracts ensure no residual debt remains in the position to be repaid. If the positions are in the wrong order, we can click the arrow between the input panels to switch them. To switch the currencies in the swap, we can click the down arrow - we would then borrow USDC and repay potential WBTC debt. Following the trade, we'll notice that the original USDC debt position has been completely replaced with a WBTC debt position. After executing a debt swap with the maximum repay amount selected, no leftover debt will persist. Swap collateral One of 1delta's key features is the ability to trade collateral without the need to withdraw and repay debt. By selecting two collateral positions, we can easily swap them. In this example, we aim to exchange our WETH collateral for USDC collateral. We choose two collateral positions to execute a collateral swap. Upon pressing the trade button, we'll access the configuration. By selecting all available WETH to swap, our entire WETH collateral position will be converted to a USDC collateral position: The input panel headers indicate which lending protocol interaction occurs for each position - in a collateral swap, the top currency is withdrawn to repay the bottom one. After approving the withdrawal and executing the transaction, we'll see that our entire collateral position has been exchanged: Post-execution view of the transaction shown in the previous screenshot. Close a margin position In the event that our health factor drops rapidly, we can prevent liquidation with just a single click. 1delta enables us to directly withdraw, swap, and repay a loan in one simple step. In this case, similar to opening a margin position, we'll need to select one currency on the collateral side (the currency we want to withdraw) and another on the debt side (the currency we want to repay). Upon clicking the trade button, either click on the arrow or the \"Close position instead\" button to reduce our position. We'll need to approve the 1Delta contract's withdrawal of collateral on our behalf, as demonstrated in the following screenshot. Approval of withdrawal is required before closing our position. After executing the trade, we'll notice that no debt position remains. When selecting the maximum amount, no residual debt will persist in the position Subsequently, we can withdraw all our collateral as described in the initial step. Conclusion By following the steps outlined in this guide, you have successfully opened an approximately 3x leveraged long position in WETH, switched the exposure to short BTC, and closed the entire position. It's important to note that all actions demonstrated above can be executed in any order and using multiple currencies for both the collateral and debt sides.© 1delta https://1delta.io/Found an error in the docs?

Create an account To begin trading, you will need to create a 1Delta account. The account provides you with flexibility, control and is very cheap to create — only minor gas fees are incurred. Deposit collateral Once the account is created, you can deposit funds to the lending protocol. If you do not currently own the token you want to deposit, you can also swap and then supply in the same transaction using a Uniswap-style interface: Open a margin position - Borrow, Swap and Supply in a single Click It is now time to trade on margin. With your deposited collateral you can now use the full capacity of your borrowing power. The following screenshot shows an indication of a position increase where WETH is borrowed and sold for USDC - which is directly deposited. All the relevant risk parameters are shown, in the scenario, the user sees a warning that the account will get close to liquidation after execution. Close a margin position - Withdraw, Swap and Repay in a single Click If our health factor gets very low, the manual withdraw-swap-repay cycle would lead to a significant hassle when trying to unwind the position, all while 1Delta executes the interactions in a single transaction: Our health factor is immediately restored if we trim the full position by selecting the maximum output amount on the right hand side. The dApp will also make sure that there is no dust left. We can see that the health factor jumps up and the LTV drops to zero. On top of that, 1delta's implementation prevents dust if you pick the maximum amount for closing a position.© 1delta https://1delta.io/Found an error in the docs? The source code can be found here.

Generally, lending protocols fall into two categories when trying to compose trades with them. First, we have protocols that allow a user to delegate borrows and withdrawals. This means that a user can approve that another contract can borrow using their collateral or withdraw collateral from their balances directly. This is very similar to the conventional ERC20 approval mechanism that allows this exact mechanic for regular transfers. This architecture allows an external contract to aggregate the position on the user's behalf - meaning that the contract can directly operate on the user's balance. Compound V3, Venus.io AAVE V3 are protocols in this category. On the other hand, we have protocols that do not allow this type of delegation. In this case, users can create abstract account that will build the positions on their behalf. These abstract accounts are smart contracts that can only be operated by the user that created them. Compound V2 and forks fall into this category. Delegation Architecture Abstract Account Architecture © 1delta https://1delta.io/Found an error in the docs? The source code can be found here.
