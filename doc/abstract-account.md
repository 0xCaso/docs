# 1delta Abstract Accounts

1delta Accounts are user-controlled smart contracts that allow the automation of lending pool interactions and their connecting swaps. 
Flash loans / swaps are used to execute the interactions in a single transaction â€” this would mostly be impossible without abstract accounts on lending protocols similar to Compound.
