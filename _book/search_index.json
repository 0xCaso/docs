to the 1delta Docs!\n1delta is a decentralized margin aggregator service that allows users to directly build margin positions using established DEXs and lending protocols. Our objective is to bring a universal aggregator service (comparable to Interactive Brokers in CeFi) to EVMs. Unbound by our own liquidity, we do not have the same limitations that comparable decentralized aggregators experience. Our goal is to partner with and aggregate established protocols in the space and not to directly compete against them.\nAt the moment, crypto traders are limited in the options they have for building leverage while trading. If they choose to use money market protocols for building margin positions they will face a multi-step process that spans multiple dApps, is error-prone, and has low visibility.\nExisting aggregator/derivatives platforms have been the go-to solution for leveraged trading, however, they come with a steep tradeoff.  While centralized players like FTX have failed users by misusing their funds, decentralized platforms like dYdX or GMX are required to provide both lending and trading liquidity often resulting in poor trading performance.\nOur vision is to bring fully-featured, decentralized aggregator services to EVMs. This includes\n\nSingle-click margin trading (opening, closing positions, debt- and collateral swaps)\nConnecting established DEXs with established lending protocols to allow our users to access top-notch trading performance and highly competitive deposit and borrow rates\nSeamless UX and visibility - easy risk management through risk parameter displays and single-click self-liquidations\nFull transparency - Users hold the lending protocol balances themselves and can always see and access their raw balances with the lender\nLending protocols have been less accessible to traders who are looking for a fully-featured aggregator.

First, we have protocols that allow a user to delegate borrows and withdrawals. This means that a user can approve that another contract can borrow using their collateral or withdraw collateral from their balances directly. This is very similar to the conventional ERC20 approval mechanism that alows this exact mechanic for regulr transfers.\nThis architecture allows an external contract to aggregate the position on the user's behalf - meaning that the constract can directly operte on the user's balance.\nCompound V3 and AAVE V3 are protocols in this category.\nOn the other hand, we have protocols that do not allow this type of delegation. In this case, users can create abstract account that will build the positions on their behalf. These abstract accounts are smart contracts that can only be operated by the user that created them.\nCompound V2 and similar protocols like Venus.io fall into this category.\n\nBroker Architecture\nAbstract Account Architecture\n\n"},"doc/broker.html":{"url":"doc/broker.html","title":"Broker architecture","keywords":"","body":"Broker Structure\nThe architecture for protocols that allow delegated borrowing and withdrawals is provided as follows.\nIn a first step, the user has to approve that the \"Broker contract\" can interact on their behalf.
